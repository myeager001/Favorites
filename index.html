    <h1>Cities that I have lived</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in Newark and at very young age moved to La Verne.
      When I was in second grade we moved from CA to TX where I lived in a
      small city called Boerne.  When I was in high school we moved to Austin
      where I went to college.  After college I moved to Denver.

    <h1>Cities That I want to Visit</h1>
    <p>
      I would love to visit Portland and Seatle beacuse I have heard that they are
      very scienic.  The food, beer and wine secene is also another reason I would
      love to see those cities.  I would like to go to DC for the historical perspective.
